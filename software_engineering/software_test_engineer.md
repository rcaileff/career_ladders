# Software Engineer I
## Test Process
* Executes a defined set of steps during testing individual tasks with direction.
* Creates a defined set of steps for others to execute while testing individual tasks.
* Understands how and why tools, processes and techniques are used during testing.
* Can setup and use common development frameworks and tools (for example  IDE, logging tools, unit testing, performance monitoring, source control and automated build tools).

## Test Management
* Identifies opportunities for automation during testing.
* Works proactively with software engineers to recommend changes to underlying code that would ease and improve testing automation.

# Software Engineer II
## Test Process
* Executes a defined set of steps during testing individual tasks without direction.
* Executes testing strategy project wide.

## Test Management
* Researches, recommends, and implements new test tools, techniques, processes, and libraries for specific project/feature.
* Owns and maintains project-specific test infrastructure and test suite.

# Sr. Software Engineer I
## Test Process
* Mentors Test I/II engineers progress through assigned QA tasks
* Serves as Core's gatekeeper for testing.

## Test Management
* Researches, recommends, and implements new test tools, techniques, processes, and libraries for a project or Core.
* Ensures tests are implemented for all relevant scopes and categories (unit, staging, performance, etc.).

# Sr. Software Engineer II
## Test Process
Same as SE I.

## Test Management
* Researches, recommends, and implements new test tools, techniques, processes, and libraries for use team-wide.
* Performs proof of concept projects with new tools or technologies to evolve deployment and development environments.

# Lead Software Engineer
## Test Process
* Works with Test I/II/Sr. engineers to deliver tested projects/features.

## Test Management
* Researches, recommends, and implements new test tools, techniques, processes, and libraries for use across multiple teams.
* Works with SE Manager to define testing strategy across a Core.
* Manages and oversees the execution of a Core's testing strategy.
